Style NFI Map

In VietNam, we have National Forest Map. They have to based on a regulation. We often style it on Mapinfo Software.
But when opening in QGIS, the uses have to style again. So I make this plugin to quickly style color. This plugin make style for some type data: 
- Forest layer
- Road
- River 1
- River 2 (polygon)
- Compartment
- Sub-compartment
- Main contour
- Detail contour
